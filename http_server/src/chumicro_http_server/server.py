"""HTTP/1.1 server built on chumicro-sockets + chumicro-timing.

:class:`HttpServer` is the entry point.  Runner-shaped —
:meth:`check(now_ms) -> bool` reports whether work is pending;
:meth:`handle(now_ms)` performs one tick of progress.  No threads,
no async — cooperative dispatch in the caller's tick loop.

Per-connection state machine::

    WANT_REQUEST_LINE
      -> WANT_HEADERS
        -> WANT_BODY            (skipped when Content-Length absent/0)
          -> DISPATCHING        (handler runs synchronously here)
            -> WANT_SEND_HEADERS
              -> DONE
                           \\-> ERROR (any state)

The handler is called once, after the full request (headers + any
``Content-Length`` body) has been parsed.  Bounded multi-connection
(``max_connections``), per-tick recv / send byte budgets, and a
``@server.route`` decorator with method dispatch + single trailing
path parameter are all wired up.

        Args:
            transport_factory: Callable ``() -> ListeningSocket`` that
                opens a non-blocking listener (typically
                ``lambda: listener(host, port,
                radio=wifi.radio)``).  Invoked once on the first
                :meth:`handle` call.
            handler: Optional fallback callable
                ``(Request) -> Response`` for paths that don't match
                any route registered via :meth:`route`.  If ``None``
                (the default), unrouted paths return 404.  Useful for
                single-handler servers without route registration and
                for catch-alls under a routed server.
            max_connections: Cap on simultaneous in-flight connections.
                Default 4 — sized for Pi Pico W heap.
            request_timeout_ms: Per-connection deadline.  A connection
                that hasn't reached ``DONE`` is dropped + the socket
                is closed.
            recv_budget_per_tick: Per-connection recv cap per
                :meth:`handle` call.  The recv scratch is 512 B, so a
                larger budget drains in up to ``budget // 512``
                recv-and-feed iterations per tick against a fast peer —
                raising it trades tick latency for throughput.  Keep it
                small so concurrent connections and runner tasks keep
                getting CPU time within the per-tick budget.
            send_budget_per_tick: Per-connection send cap per
                :meth:`handle` call.  Higher than recv because
                response bodies are typically small + we want them
                drained in one tick when possible.
            max_request_body_bytes: Cap on a single buffered request
                body.  Default 16 KB.  Bigger bodies are rejected
                with 413 Payload Too Large at headers-complete time,
                before any body bytes are allocated.
            max_request_line_bytes: Cap on the request-line length
                (method + target + version).  Default 1 KB.  A request
                line that reaches the cap without a CRLF is rejected
                with 414 URI Too Long — bounds the buffer a no-CRLF
                dribble can grow before the request-timeout deadline.
            max_headers_bytes: Cap on the total header-section bytes.
                Default 4 KB.  Headers exceeding the cap are rejected
                with 431 Request Header Fields Too Large — bounds the
                buffer a slow header dribble can grow.
            stream_buffer_size: Staging-window size, in bytes, for a
                :class:`StreamingResponse` (default 1 KB).  Minted lazily
                (only a connection that streams allocates one) and reused,
                so it is the whole per-stream heap cost regardless of body
                size or a stalled client.  A larger window amortizes the
                per-send and chunk-framing overhead at the cost of RAM per
                concurrent stream.
            ticks: Optional tick source — any object exposing
                ``ticks_ms``, ``ticks_diff``, ``ticks_add`` (matches
                the ``chumicro_timing.ticks`` submodule shape).
                Defaults to that submodule (real clock); tests pass
