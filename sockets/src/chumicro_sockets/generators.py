"""Generator helpers for socket I/O driven by a tick-based scheduler.

Opt-in submodule — import explicitly::

    from chumicro_sockets.generators import connect, recv_until, send_all

The four helpers — ``connect``, ``send_all``, ``recv_until``,
``recv_exact`` — let a generator express a socket lifecycle
top-to-bottom::

    def echo_run(connector):
        sock = yield from connect(connector)
        try:
            yield from send_all(sock, b"hello\\n")
            reply = yield from recv_until(sock, b"\\n", max_bytes=4096)
        finally:
            sock.close()

The helpers operate on **duck-typed** inputs:

* ``connect`` takes any object exposing the ``SocketConnector``
  surface (``state`` / ``socket`` / ``last_error`` / ``io_socket`` /
  ``io_interest`` / ``tick`` / ``cancel``) and
  yields it directly, so the driving scheduler reads the connector's
  own interest progression through DNS / TCP / TLS / ready.
* ``send_all`` / ``recv_until`` / ``recv_exact`` take any non-blocking
  socket exposing ``send`` / ``recv_into`` that raises
  ``OSError(EAGAIN)`` when it would block.  They yield the
  ``ReadWait`` / ``WriteWait`` markers from ``chumicro_sockets.waits``,
  carrying the socket so the scheduler registers it for the right poll
  direction.

Heap-DoS protection: ``recv_until`` and ``recv_exact`` both require
``max_bytes`` and refuse to allocate above it — ``recv_until`` caps the
accumulator it grows, ``recv_exact`` caps the fixed buffer it pre-allocates
so a peer-controlled ``byte_count`` can't force an unbounded allocation.
Both reject non-positive sizes up front.

def connect(
    connector: object,
    *,
    timeout_ms: int | None = None,
    ticks: object | None = None,
) -> object:
    """Drive *connector* across runner ticks; return its connected socket.

    Yields the connector itself on every tick so the wrapper reads
    ``connector.io_socket`` / ``io_interest(now_ms)``
    directly — the connector's own interest progression through
    DNS -> TCP -> (TLS) -> ready is what gates the ipoll
    registration.  Returns the connected, non-blocking socket via
    PEP 380 — call as ``sock = yield from connect(connector)``.

    The connector's per-phase blocking compromises still apply:
    CircuitPython's TCP+TLS collapse into one blocking ``connect()``
    inside a single tick; MicroPython's TLS handshake blocks inline.
    The synchronous-tick parts of those phases stall the runner for
    their duration — no different from driving the connector under a
    check / handle service.

    Each resume threads the runner's ``now_ms`` into
    ``connector.tick(now_ms)`` so a connector that tracks its own
    deadline sees the real clock; the priming tick before the first
    resume passes ``0``.

    On cancellation (``GeneratorExit``) or failure, the connector's
    ``cancel`` runs in a ``finally`` block so any in-flight socket
    closes cleanly.

    Args:
        connector: Any object exposing the ``SocketConnector``
            surface — ``state``, ``socket``, ``last_error``,
            ``io_socket``, ``io_interest(now_ms)``,
            ``tick(now_ms)``, ``cancel()``.  The real
            ``chumicro_sockets.connector()`` returns such objects;
            ``FakeSocketConnector`` in ``chumicro_sockets.testing``
            is the test stand-in.
        timeout_ms: Optional deadline in milliseconds for the whole
            connect (DNS attempt + TCP + optional TLS).  ``None``
            (default) waits indefinitely.  On expiry the connector is
            cancelled and ``OSError(ETIMEDOUT)`` is raised.  The DNS
            lookup runs as one synchronous ``getaddrinfo`` inside the
            connector's first tick and is blocking-by-substrate on real
            boards, so a hang *inside* that call cannot be interrupted —
            the deadline is only checked between ticks.
        ticks: ``chumicro_timing``-shaped tick source
            (``ticks_ms`` / ``ticks_add`` / ``ticks_diff``).  Required
            when *timeout_ms* is set; ignored otherwise.

    Yields:
        The connector itself, repeatedly, until terminal.

    Returns:
        Connected socket — non-blocking, ready for ``send`` /
        ``recv_into``.  The caller owns lifecycle (``sock.close()``
        in a ``try / finally`` or ``with`` block).

    Raises:
        OSError: Connector reached ``failed`` (DNS lookup, TCP
            connect, or TLS handshake failed) — the connector's
            ``last_error`` is raised — or ``ETIMEDOUT`` when
            *timeout_ms* elapsed before the connector became ready.
        ValueError: *timeout_ms* was given without a *ticks* source.
