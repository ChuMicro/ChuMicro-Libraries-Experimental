"""Advance a non-blocking TCP/TLS connect across multiple ``tick(now_ms)`` calls.

The one connect state machine — ``chumicro_sockets.connector()``
returns a per-runtime subclass of :class:`SocketConnector`.  Library
methods that perform network I/O do not block: a runner-shaped library
constructs a connector and advances it across ticks.  Non-runner
contexts (one-shot scripts, REPL, ``main`` before the runner loop
starts) drive the same machine to terminal inline with a small
``while``-loop.

Each call to :meth:`SocketConnector.tick` advances the connector by one
phase.  Phase boundaries are uniform across runtimes:

* ``awaiting_dns`` — resolve ``host`` to an address.
* ``awaiting_tcp`` — TCP connect in progress.
* ``awaiting_tls`` — TLS handshake in progress.
* ``ready`` — terminal; :attr:`socket` is the connected socket.
* ``failed`` — terminal; :attr:`last_error` is set; :attr:`socket` is ``None``.

*How* a runtime moves between phases is its own concern — CPython runs
three genuine non-blocking phases; MP collapses the TLS handshake into
one blocking tick (no ``do_handshake_on_connect=False`` on its mbedTLS
binding); CP collapses TCP + TLS into one blocking ``connect()`` call
and skips the ``awaiting_tls`` phase entirely.  Each per-runtime
adapter implements its own :meth:`tick` to encode that flow.

This base class owns the runner-contract surface
(``check`` / ``handle`` / ``io_socket`` / ``io_interest`` /
``next_deadline`` / ``cancel``) plus the
terminal-state bookkeeping (``_fail`` close-on-failure, ``cancel``
close-on-abort).
