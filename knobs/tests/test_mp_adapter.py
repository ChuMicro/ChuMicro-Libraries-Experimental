"""Tests for the MicroPython sources: the quadrature decode, one edge at a time.

The shaft, the two pins under it, and the ``machine`` stub that lets the source import off
a board all live in ``_mp_helpers``.  What that buys is the one property a board test
cannot show cheaply: the decode replayed edge by edge, with the shaft parked anywhere in
its cycle, turned either way, wobbled on a boundary the way a worn detent wobbles, and fed
the both-pins-at-once transition a noisy encoder produces.  Real pins, real interrupt
latency, and real contact bounce stay in ``functional_tests/``.

The module under test is MicroPython-marked, so a CircuitPython deploy never carries it;
this file stays on the host lane where importing it always resolves.
