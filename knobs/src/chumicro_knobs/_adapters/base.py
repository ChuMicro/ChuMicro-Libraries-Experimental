#: A converter's noise is jumpy rather than merely wide, and it is the jumpiness that defeats
#: the deadband above it.  That deadband anchors on whichever sample tripped it, so a reading
#: that leaps between noise extremes drags the anchor across a step boundary and back.  This
#: removes the leaping, which is what lets the deadband behave the way it reads.  Four is the
#: smallest shift that holds a parked knob on one number; at two it still wanders.

    and takes dozens of conversions to drain back out, while a discarded one moves nothing.
