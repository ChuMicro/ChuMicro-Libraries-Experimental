"""HTTP/1.1 client built on chumicro-sockets + chumicro-timing.

:class:`HttpClient` is the entry point.  Runner-shaped —
:meth:`check(now_ms) -> bool` reports whether work is pending;
:meth:`handle(now_ms)` performs one tick of progress.  No threads,
no async — cooperative dispatch in the caller's tick loop.

Single-in-flight in v1: :meth:`HttpClient.get` / ``post`` / etc.
while a request is still running raises :class:`HttpBusyError`.  The
user pattern::

    client = HttpClient(transport_factory=...)
    handle = client.get("http://api.example.com/now", timeout_ms=5000)

    while not handle.done:
        if client.check(now_ms()):
            client.handle(now_ms())

    response = handle.result   # raises on failure

This module ships GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE over HTTP and
HTTPS (an ``https://`` URL selects TLS), JSON request bodies via
``json=...``, automatic 3xx redirect following (capped, and
method-preserving where the status requires it), and response
bodies via ``Content-Length``, ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked``, or
read-until-close — buffered whole by default, or streamed
incrementally into a caller-owned buffer with ``stream=True``
(``handle.read_body_into``), so a body larger than the heap is
consumable at a fixed RAM cost.

                  absence is tolerated.

                :func:`chumicro_sockets_connector_factory` is one
                valid producer; any zero-network-side fake or wrapper
                returning a connector-shaped object works too.
            recv_budget_per_tick: Soft cap on bytes drained from the
                socket in a single :meth:`handle` call.  Default 1024.
                The recv scratch is 512 B, so against a fast peer a
                larger budget drains in up to ``budget // 512``
                recv-and-feed iterations per tick — raising it trades
                tick latency for throughput.  Keep it small (a few
                hundred bytes to a couple KB) so concurrent runner tasks
                (LED blink, control loop) keep getting CPU time within
                the per-tick budget.
            max_body_bytes: Cap on a single response body.  Default
                64 KB — minimum supported board has 256 KB MCU RAM,
                so 64 KB leaves headroom.  Not applied to requests
                issued with ``stream=True``: a streamed body's RAM
                bound is *stream_buffer_size* plus the caller's own
                buffer, so the body may be any size.
            when_oversized: Policy for responses above the cap.  See
                :class:`WhenOversized`.  Never fires for streamed
                requests (the cap does not apply there).
            stream_buffer_size: Staging capacity, in bytes, for each
                request issued with ``stream=True`` — the most decoded
                body bytes held while waiting for the caller to drain
                them via ``RequestHandle.read_body_into``.  Allocated
                per streamed request (so a finished-but-undrained
                handle never aliases the next request's staging) and
                default 1024.  Buffered requests never allocate it.
            default_timeout_ms: Default per-request timeout in ms.
                Overridable per-call via ``timeout_ms=...``.  Default
                10 000 ms.
            default_max_redirects: Default cap on 3xx hops the client
                follows.  When the budget is exhausted the last 3xx
                response is returned as-is (not an ``HttpError``), same
                as ``max_redirects=0``.  Overridable per-call via
                ``max_redirects=...``.
                ``0`` returns the 3xx response as-is without
                following.  Default 5.
            user_agent: Override the default ``User-Agent`` header.
            ticks: Optional tick source — any object exposing
                ``ticks_ms``, ``ticks_diff``, ``ticks_add`` (matches
                the ``chumicro_timing.ticks`` submodule shape).
                Defaults to that submodule (real clock); tests pass
