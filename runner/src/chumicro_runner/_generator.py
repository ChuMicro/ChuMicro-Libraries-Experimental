"""Generator adapter for ``Runner.add_generator``.

Bridges a Python generator function (``def`` + ``yield`` / ``yield from``)
into the runner's check / handle / io_* protocol.  The wrapper is
fully duck-typed: a generator yields *anything* that exposes the
attributes the wrapper inspects.  No named protocol classes required.

The duck-typed wait protocol — every attribute optional, defaults to
None / False:

* ``io_socket``: the underlying pollable the runner should register
  with ipoll, or ``None``.
* ``io_interest(now_ms) -> int``: bitmask (``chumicro_runner.IO_READ`` /
  ``IO_WRITE``) of the poll directions to register the socket for; 0 or
  an absent hook registers nothing.
* ``next_deadline``: absolute tick at which the wrapper should resume
  the generator; ``None`` means "resume on the next tick after an
  ipoll wake or any other deadline elapses."
* ``ready(now_ms) -> bool``: optional event predicate.  A wait
  exposing it (and no socket) suspends the generator until ``ready``
  returns True or ``next_deadline`` elapses (the timeout path) — the
  shape ``chumicro_timing.waits.Signal`` implements for
  completions that originate in callback-style services.

A bare ``yield`` (sending ``None``) suspends for exactly one tick:
the wrapper substitutes a private next-tick wait, so ``None`` in the
wait slot strictly means the generator finished.

The ``SocketConnector`` from ``chumicro_sockets`` already exposes
these attributes natively, so a generator that wraps it can simply
``yield connector`` — no extra wrapping needed.  Helper functions
build small private wait objects for the other cases: the socket
helpers in ``chumicro_sockets.generators`` for a bare socket,
``sleep_until`` in ``chumicro_runner.generators`` for a deadline,
``Signal`` / ``wait_for`` in ``chumicro_timing.waits`` for a
callback-completed event.

Sequential I/O state machines that would otherwise need an explicit
per-state ``check`` / ``handle`` object collapse to a top-to-bottom
generator body.  The substrate is plain Python generators driven via
``.send()`` / ``.throw()`` / ``.close()`` — no ``async`` / ``await``
keywords involved, and no event loop other than the runner's own tick
loop.

``GeneratorHandle`` is the public face returned by ``add_generator``;
``_GeneratorWrapper`` is the runner-protocol adapter that users never
touch directly.
