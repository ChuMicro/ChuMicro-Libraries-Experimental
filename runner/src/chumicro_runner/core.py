"""Tick-based scheduler for the ChuMicro libraries.

Register work with a ``Runner``, then call ``tick()`` in a loop.
Each ``tick()`` captures the current time once, checks every
registered task, and fires the handlers whose gates have passed.

Two registration shapes are accepted: object-based (``.check`` +
``.handle`` methods) and handler-only (fires every tick, or per
period if one is set).  See ``Runner.add`` for signatures.
``add_periodic`` is the periodic shortcut; ``add_generator`` drives
a linear generator flow.

``TaskHandle`` (returned from registration) carries runtime state
and supports ``set_period`` / ``remove``.

The optional ``Runner.wait(now_ms)`` companion idles the CPU between
ticks, blocking on a ``select.poll`` over each service's exposed
sockets (or sleeping until the next deadline when no socket is
registered).  See ``Runner.wait`` for the contract.

Cross-runtime: CPython, MicroPython, CircuitPython.

        1. Check each entry (period gate, then check gate).
           Collect entries whose handlers should fire.
        2. Batch-fire all collected handlers.
        3. Decrement run counts and auto-remove exhausted entries.

        A ``check`` function must not add or remove runner tasks: phase 1
        walks the entry list in place, so a task added or removed from
        inside a check is skipped or shifts a neighbor out of this tick's
        scan.  Mutate the task set from a handler instead — phase 2 fires
        handlers off a separate batched list, so ``add`` and
        ``handle.remove()`` from a handler are safe.

        A handler raising ``Exception`` is isolated: the error is
        counted in ``handler_errors``, reported to the optional
        ``on_handler_error`` callback, and the remaining due handlers
        still fire this tick.  ``KeyboardInterrupt`` / ``SystemExit`` /
        ``GeneratorExit`` are not ``Exception`` subclasses, so they
        still propagate and stop the loop.  A handler that re-enters
        ``tick()`` raises ``ReentrantTickError``, which propagates past
        the isolation because re-entering the reactor is framework
        misuse, not a service fault.

        Returns:
            The tick timestamp used this cycle.

        Raises:
            ReentrantTickError: A handler called ``tick()`` while this
                ``tick()`` was already running.

        Companion to ``tick()``.  The application calls it in its loop
        right after ``tick()`` to let the CPU sleep between events::

            while True:
                now_ms = runner.tick()
                runner.wait(now_ms)

        On each call ``wait``:

        1. Re-reads each entry's optional ``io_socket`` and
           ``io_interest(now_ms)`` bitmask and syncs the registered poll
           set on diff (register new sockets, modify changed interest,
           unregister stale sockets).
        2. Computes the wait timeout as the minimum of every entry's
           ``next_due_ms`` and every service's
           ``next_deadline(now_ms)``, minus *now_ms*.
        3. Blocks in ``ipoll(timeout_ms)`` over the registered poll set
           if any socket is registered — indefinitely when no entry
           contributes a deadline, so a purely socket-driven service
           set parks the CPU until an event fires.  With no sockets
           registered, sleeps the timeout: the socket-less sleep
           delegates to the injected tick source's ``sleep_ms`` when it
           has one (so a ``FakeTicks`` advances its own clock instead
           of burning wall time), otherwise the runtime
           ``time.sleep_ms`` / ``time.sleep``.  Returns immediately
           when the next deadline is already due, or when there is
           neither a socket nor a deadline to wait on.

        For each ipoll event whose mask carries POLLERR or POLLHUP
        (socket error / hangup), looks up the registered service whose
        ``io_socket`` matches the polled object and calls its optional
        ``io_error(now_ms, eventmask)`` hook so the service can transition
        cleanly to a failure state.  That delivery runs on the one
        snapshot-iterated, ``_record_handler_fault``-isolated lane the
        tick handlers use, so an ``io_error`` that faults (or a generator
        service that lets the throw propagate) is counted and contained,
        never able to escape ``wait()`` or corrupt the entry list it
        dispatches over.  Services without ``io_error`` receive no
        notification; the runner ignores the error event and ``check``
        re-gates dispatch on the next ``tick`` as usual.

        POLLIN / POLLOUT events are wake signals only -- ``check`` and
        ``next_deadline`` decide what runs.  Waking the loop and
        dispatching handlers stay separate concerns.
