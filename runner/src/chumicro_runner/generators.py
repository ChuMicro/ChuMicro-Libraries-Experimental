``sleep_until`` suspends a generator registered via
``Runner.add_generator`` until an absolute tick arrives.  It is a
scheduler-side companion to the socket I/O generator helpers in
``chumicro_sockets.generators`` (which gate on poll readiness) and to
the completion-wait vocabulary ``Signal`` / ``wait_for`` in
``chumicro_timing.waits`` (which gates on a callback-style event).

    The wrapper reads ``next_deadline`` off the yielded wait and
    contributes it to ``Runner.wait``'s ipoll timeout so the loop
    sleeps efficiently between sleep-only services.

    Compute *until_ms* via ``ticks_add(ticks_ms(), delay_ms)`` —
    treating it as an absolute tick (wrap-safe) rather than a delay
    means a single yield won't drift across long pauses.

    Args:
        until_ms: Absolute ``ticks_ms`` value at which to resume.

    Yields:
        A private deadline-wait carrying *until_ms*.
