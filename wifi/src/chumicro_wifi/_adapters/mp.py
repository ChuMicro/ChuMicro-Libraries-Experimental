"""MicroPython ``network.WLAN`` adapter for ESP-IDF and CYW43 wifi stacks.

Wraps ``network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)`` on either stack.  The
substrate API is identical between the two, so one class covers
both.  Two stack-specific knobs are applied conditionally:

* **ESP-IDF** (ESP32, S2, S3, C3, C6, …): after the first
  successful connect, ``wlan.config(reconnects=0)`` disables the
  firmware-level auto-reconnect supervisor so ``WifiService``
  drives retries.
* **CYW43** (Pi Pico W, …): at configure time, when
  ``WifiConfig.power_save`` is ``False`` (default),
  ``wlan.config(pm=0xa11140)`` disables CYW43 idle power-save
  (eliminates ~30-100 ms tick spikes on chip wake-up).  CYW43
  has no firmware reconnect supervisor, so no ``reconnects``
  knob is issued.

Stack detection lives in :meth:`MpWifiAdapter._detect_stack`.
Tests inject the stack explicitly via ``stack="espidf"`` /
``stack="cyw43"`` to exercise both branches on CPython without
hardware.

``wlan`` defaults to a fresh ``network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)``.
Tests inject a fake matching the substrate's surface.  ``name``
is ``"mp_esp32"`` on ESP-IDF or ``"mp_rp2"`` on CYW43, the
value users read via ``wifi.adapter.name``.
