"""``WifiService``: state machine + reconnect supervisor.

Drives the substrate adapter through connect, monitor, and
reconnect, and tracks state in the runner's tick loop.

State machine (``WifiState`` constants)::

    DISCONNECTED -> CONNECTING -> CONNECTED
                        |            |
                        |            v
                        |       RECONNECTING (on link drop)
                        |            |
                        v            v
                     FAILED <--- backoff exhausted (only when reconnect_max set)

Runner contract: ``check(now_ms)`` returns ``True`` when the next
event is due (initial connect, reconnect attempt, link-down
detection).  ``handle(now_ms)`` does one tick of substrate work.

    ``WifiConfig.connect_timeout_ms`` (default 15 s).  MicroPython and
