"""Host-lane tests for the edge sources a laptop cannot build.

Picking an edge source is a per-runtime import, and CPython has no GPIO to
import for.  Discrete pins and a row-by-column grid pick separately and refuse
separately, so both refusals are checked.  This is true only off a board: a real
CircuitPython or MicroPython run builds a source here instead of raising, so each
test skips loudly on those runtimes.

Real-hardware coverage of the built sources lives under ``functional_tests/``.
