"""A button that flips the onboard LED, on CircuitPython.

Reads a physical button and toggles the LED on every press.  A long press
turns the LED off and prints how long it was held, so you can feel the
difference between a tap and a hold without any extra wiring.

Setup:
1. Install ``chumicro_buttons`` (``circup install chumicro_buttons``).
2. Wire a momentary button between the chosen GPIO and **GND**.  The internal
   pull-up is switched on for you, so no extra parts are needed.  Many boards
   (Feather, QT Py, Metro) expose a built-in button as ``board.BUTTON``.
3. Save this file as ``code.py`` on the board.

Example output::

    Press to toggle the LED.  Hold to turn it off.

      [  815 ms] press -> LED on
      [ 1407 ms] press -> LED off
      [ 2260 ms] held 500 ms -> LED off

Runs on CircuitPython.
