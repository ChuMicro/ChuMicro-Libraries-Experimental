    """A keypad whose keys sit where a row crosses a column, read one key at a time.

    Wiring keys as a grid is what lets twelve of them share seven pins, and every key still
    reads as an ordinary button: ``matrix[5]`` is a :class:`~chumicro_buttons.core.Button` with
    its own ``pressed``, its own edges, and its own long press, repeat, and click counting.
    Keys are numbered row-major, so the key at ``row``, ``column`` is
    ``row * len(column_pins) + column``, and with three columns key 4 is row 1, column 1.

    CircuitPython drives the grid in the firmware's own background scan; MicroPython drives it
    once per ``check(now_ms)``, because a grid has to be scanned a row at a time and column
    interrupts would report keys nobody touched.

    Args:
        row_pins: Runtime pin objects for the rows.
        column_pins: Runtime pin objects for the columns.
        ticks: The clock every duration here is judged by, ``chumicro_timing.ticks`` or
            anything shaped like it.  Required, and it reaches the scan and every key below,
            so the whole keypad measures against one time base.
        source: Pre-built edge source; overrides the pins.  Tests inject a fake here.
        columns_to_anodes: Which way the matrix's diodes face.  Leave it True when each
            diode's striped end points at a row pin, which is how ready-made keypads are built.
            Guessing wrong is quiet rather than damaging: the diodes block the scan and no key
            ever reads as pressed, so a keypad that reports nothing is the symptom to try it on.
        settle_ms: Debounce window in milliseconds; 0 trusts the signal.
        long_press_ms: Hold time that fires ``just_long_pressed``.  Zero disables it.
        repeat_ms: Interval between repeat fires while held.  Zero disables it.
        repeat_delay_ms: Hold time before repeat starts.
        click_ms: Quiet time that closes a click series.  Zero disables click counting.
