    Every reading is a plain attribute refreshed by ``check(now_ms)``, and the ``just_`` family
    is true only for the tick the thing happened on, so a loop can read them without consuming
    anything.  A switch that stays where you put it uses the same object, reading ``pressed``
    and watching the edges for when it moved.  Constructing with ``pin`` builds the runtime's
    own source, a firmware ``keypad`` scan on CircuitPython and a capture interrupt on
    MicroPython, and both catch a tap that starts and ends between two passes of your loop.

    Args:
        pin: Runtime pin object for the key, or None when a parent drives this button.
        ticks: The clock every duration here is judged by, ``chumicro_timing.ticks`` or
            anything shaped like it.  Required, and it is the only clock this library reads,

            debounces against share one time base.
        source: Pre-built edge source; overrides ``pin``.  Tests inject a fake here.
        active_low: True when a pressed key reads low.  True suits a button wired to ground
            with the internal pull-up enabled, which is nearly always the wiring.
        settle_ms: Debounce window in milliseconds, and the shortest press that can be
            reported.  Raise it for a switch that bounces badly, lower it for fast tapping,
            and use zero for a button with hardware debouncing behind it.
        long_press_ms: Hold time that fires ``just_long_pressed``.  Zero disables it.
        repeat_ms: Interval between ``just_repeated`` fires while held.  Zero disables it.
        repeat_delay_ms: Hold time before repeat starts.
        click_ms: Quiet time after a release that closes a click series and publishes
